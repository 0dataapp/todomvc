# TodoMVC: JavaScript Es5

This is [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/examples/javascript-es5/dist/) integrated with [remoteStorage.js](https://remotestorage.io/rs.js/docs/).

You can run this by simply opening `index.html` in your browser, and it will even sync between multiple tabs.

From the original [project source](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/examples/javascript-es5):

## Description

This application uses JavaScript with ES5 language features to implement a todo application.

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it..

[JavaScript - developer.mozilla.org](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript)

## Implementation Details

This implementation uses an explicit MVC pattern, with a clear file structure to reflect the architecture. The storage solution uses an in-memory data object that implements a simple array to hold the todos.
